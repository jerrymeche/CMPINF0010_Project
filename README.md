Our project is to identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Using data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC), we create a data-driven argument to support our claim about the best neighborhood. Three metrics we selected to evaluate neighborhoods are Pittsburgh police arrest data (safety), K-12 enrollment (educational resources), and number of parks (places of public entertainment). By analyzing these factors, we aim to identify the neighborhood that offers the best quality of life for its residents. We explored a few alternative metrics that could be used to evaluate neighborhoods, including income, transit systems, and races. But we ultimately decided to focus on the three metrics mentioned above, as we felt they were most closely related to the quality of life of residents in a neighborhood.

Police Incident Blotter: We used incident data as a proxy for safety, with the assumption that neighborhoods with lower incident rates are generally safer than those with higher incident rates.

Number of parks: Parks play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life in a neighborhood. They provide recreational spaces and facilities for residents, making them an important factor in determining the overall quality of a neighborhood.

K-12 enrollment: The number of K12 enrollments can reflect the educational resources available in each neighborhood. We assume that neighborhoods with more enrolled students have better or more schools. This is a crucial factor for students and their parents.
