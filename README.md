Our project is to identify the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Using data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC), we create a data-driven argument to support our claim about the best neighborhood. Three metrics we selected to evaluate neighborhoods are Pittsburgh police arrest data (safety), K-12 enrollment (educational resources), and number of parks (places of public entertainment). By analyzing these factors, we aim to identify the neighborhood that offers the best quality of life for its residents. We explored a few alternative metrics that could be used to evaluate neighborhoods, including income, transit systems, and races. But we ultimately decided to focus on the three metrics mentioned above, as we felt they were most closely related to the quality of life of residents in a neighborhood.
